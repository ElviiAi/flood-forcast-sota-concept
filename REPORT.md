# Enhancing Flood Response with Predictive Satellite Imaging

## Introduction
Dear ICEYE Team,

I am pleased to present my research findings and proposed approach for developing a predictive model to enhance flood event capture using Sentinel-1 satellite imagery. This report summarizes the extensive research conducted, the technical details of the proposed solution, and its potential to improve flood response times and support ICEYE's expansion into new regions.

## Understanding ICEYE's Challenges
To ensure that the proposed solution aligns with ICEYE's objectives, I carefully analyzed the company's key challenges:

1. Selecting regions for expansion
2. Predicting model accuracy for new regions
3. Handling data sparsity across different modalities in certain regions
4. Bridging communication gaps between the AI team and customers

These challenges were considered throughout the research and development process to create a solution that addresses ICEYE's specific needs.

## Proposed Technical Approach
The proposed approach involves using the PatchTSMixer model, a state-of-the-art transformer-based architecture designed for multivariate time series forecasting. This model has demonstrated strong performance on various benchmarks and is well-suited for flood prediction tasks. Key features of the PatchTSMixer model include:

- Handling multiple data modalities (SAR imagery, DEM, weather data) with varying availability across regions
- Robustness to missing data, ensuring reliable performance in regions with data sparsity
- Leveraging transfer learning from pre-training on the ETTh1 dataset for faster deployment in new regions
- Compatibility with open-source transformer architectures and advanced fine-tuning techniques like DPO and QLoRA

The proposed solution also includes a modular data preprocessing pipeline to normalize and integrate data from various sources, ensuring consistency across regions. The pipeline incorporates the following technical details:

- Sentinel-1 SAR data preprocessing: Normalization of raw amplitude data (VV and VH polarizations) for consistent scaling and comparability.
- Copernicus DEM data preprocessing: Normalization of elevation and slope data for consistency with other modalities.
- MET Malaysia weather data preprocessing: Normalization of precipitation and temperature data to align with model input requirements.
- Data balancing: Oversampling of the minority class (flood instances) to ensure equal representation of flood and no-flood instances.
- Train/validation split: Splitting the balanced dataset into train and validation sets (80/20) for model training and evaluation.

## Region Selection: Kuantan, Pahang, Malaysia
For the initial implementation and testing of the predictive flood model, I propose focusing on the Kuantan district in Pahang, Malaysia. The reasons for this choice are as follows:

1. High Historical Flood Frequency: Kuantan, along with Temerloh and Pekan, is highly vulnerable to floods in Pahang state due to its natural setting, changing climate, and development pressures.

2. Moderate Disaster Insurance Gap: Many residents of Kuantan lack adequate flood insurance coverage, presenting an opportunity to bridge the insurance gap and provide valuable insights for insurers and disaster relief organizations.

3. High Commercial Potential for Flood-Extent Products: Flood-extent products derived from the predictive model would be highly valuable for insurance companies, government agencies, and disaster relief organizations operating in Kuantan.

4. Availability of Data: Kuantan has relatively good coverage of Sentinel-1 SAR data, Copernicus DEM data, and weather data from MET Malaysia, making it a suitable region for initial model development and testing.

Focusing on Kuantan allows for the development and refinement of the predictive flood model in a region with high flood frequency, significant commercial potential, and adequate data availability. The insights gained from this initial implementation can inform the expansion of the model to other regions.

## Model Evaluation and Performance Metrics
To assess the model's performance, I recommend using multiple evaluation metrics:

- F1-score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of the model's accuracy in predicting flood events.
- ROC curve: Plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate at various classification thresholds, offering insights into the model's ability to discriminate between flood and no-flood instances.
- Confusion matrix: Visualizes the model's performance by comparing predicted and actual flood occurrences, providing a detailed breakdown of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

Additionally, a visual training dashboard can be developed to enhance interpretability and facilitate communication between the AI team and stakeholders, demonstrating the model's progress and potential.

## Expansion into New Regions
The proposed approach has significant potential to support ICEYE's expansion into new regions:

1. Adaptability to diverse data modalities and missing data, enabling deployment in regions with varying data landscapes.
2. Faster deployment in new regions through transfer learning from pre-training.
3. Efficient scaling and customization to meet region-specific requirements through modular data preprocessing and modeling components.
4. Proactive decision-making and resource allocation enabled by probabilistic flood predictions at a high temporal resolution.
5. Engagement with local stakeholders and experts through the visual training dashboard, incorporating region-specific insights and building trust.

## Future Enhancements
To further enhance the model's capabilities and address ICEYE's challenges, I propose the following future enhancements:

1. Auto-regressive modeling: Adapting the model to an auto-regressive architecture to test its predictability against new regions, enabling assessment of model performance without extensive data collection.

2. Real-time monitoring and early response: Transforming the model into a regressive architecture for real-time monitoring and early response to flood events, providing timely insights even with missing data modalities.

## Risks and Considerations
Implementing an untested model comes with potential risks that need to be addressed:

1. Data quality and consistency: Establishing robust data quality checks and validation processes to mitigate the impact of inconsistencies or errors in input data.

2. Model generalizability: Conducting extensive testing and validation across diverse regions to ensure the model's robustness and reliability.

3. Stakeholder acceptance: Engaging with stakeholders early in the development process, incorporating their feedback, and providing transparent communication to mitigate resistance to new predictive models.

4. Ethical considerations: Establishing clear guidelines and protocols for the responsible use of the model, ensuring transparency and accountability in the decision-making process.

5. Maintenance and updates: Establishing a robust framework for model monitoring, evaluation, and updates to ensure continued effectiveness as flood patterns and climate conditions evolve.

Addressing these risks requires collaboration between the AI team, domain experts, and stakeholders to proactively identify and mitigate potential issues.

## Next Steps
To move forward with the implementation of the predictive flood model, I recommend the following next steps:

1. Data audit: Assess the quality, consistency, and availability of relevant data for the Kuantan region, identifying gaps and developing strategies to address them.

2. Data preprocessing pipeline refinement: Collaborate with domain experts to refine the data preprocessing steps, ensuring accurate capture of relevant flood characteristics.

3. Model implementation and training: Implement the PatchTSMixer model using preprocessed data from the Kuantan region, train the model, and evaluate its performance using selected metrics.

4. Extensive testing and validation: Test the trained model on historical flood events in the Kuantan region and validate its performance using data from other regions to ensure generalizability.

5. Stakeholder engagement: Identify key stakeholders who can benefit from the predictive flood model, engage with them to understand their requirements, and incorporate their feedback into the model development process.

6. Deployment strategy development: Create a detailed plan for deploying the predictive flood model, considering scalability and maintainability of the deployment architecture.

7. Monitoring and evaluation framework establishment: Define key performance indicators (KPIs) and establish a framework for continuous monitoring and evaluation of the model's performance in real-world scenarios.

8. Ethical and legal considerations: Develop guidelines and protocols for the responsible use of the predictive flood model, ensuring transparency, accountability, and compliance with relevant regulations and ethical standards.

9. Scale and expansion planning: Develop a roadmap for expanding the predictive flood model to other regions based on the insights gained from the Kuantan region, considering the unique characteristics and data availability of each region.

10. Collaboration and knowledge sharing: Encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing among the AI team, domain experts, and stakeholders to continuously improve the model's performance and adapt to changing flood patterns and stakeholder needs.

By following these next steps, ICEYE can ensure the successful implementation and adoption of the predictive flood model, ultimately enhancing flood response and supporting expansion into new regions.

## Conclusion
The proposed predictive flood model, built upon the state-of-the-art PatchTSMixer architecture and a modular data preprocessing pipeline, has the potential to significantly improve flood response times and support ICEYE's expansion into new regions. By leveraging advanced techniques and addressing potential risks through collaboration and continuous improvement, ICEYE can establish itself as a leader in enhancing flood response through satellite imaging.

The initial focus on the Kuantan region in Pahang, Malaysia, provides an opportunity to refine the model in a region with high flood frequency, significant commercial potential, and adequate data availability. The insights gained from this implementation can inform the expansion of the model to other regions, considering their unique characteristics and data landscapes.

I look forward to further discussing the technical details, implementation plan, and long-term vision with the ICEYE team. Together, we can make a significant impact in improving flood preparedness, response, and ultimately, saving lives.

Thank you for considering my proposal.
